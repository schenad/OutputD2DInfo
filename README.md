# OutputD2DInfo
[![release](https://github.com/schenad/OutputD2DInfo/blob/master/OutputD2DInfo/Release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/schenad/OutputD2DInfo/releases)

Read in all the .D2D files (SPA-LEED 2-D scans) in the same folder and output all the information contained in the headers to an Excel file. 

## Usage

Simply put the .exe in the same folder and it will output an Excel file that contains all the information. In the folder, sample *.D2D files are provided for testing. 

Sometimes the program cannot read the last digit of the year when the data was taken, and you need to input it by hand.
